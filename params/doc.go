/*
Package params implements a structure that holds the information to be
instantiated as a set of parameters. The limits and relationships between
the given values are be checked when a Parameters structure is instantiated.
Therefore, a ParametersLiteral structure needs to be given as a set of
constants with values that are securely sound before creating a Parameters object.
